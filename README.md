# MoneyGo

MoneyGo is a simple game where an object is walk in desired area and collect coins. Totat value of coins is 100. there is 5 coins with value 5, 15 coins with value 2 and 45 coins with value 1.
Coin is collecetd when you are 50 meters or closer to it.

#### Things to improve
* User interface could be much nicer. I need to add some animations and fix color scheme
* I need to add circle around GPS position, so that user can see when he is getting closer
